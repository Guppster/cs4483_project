    // From wikipedia: Karvi
    // The Karvi(or karve) is the smallest vessel that is considered a longship.
    // According to the 10th-century Gulating Law, a ship with 13 rowing benches 
    // is the smallest ship suitable for military use.A ship with 6 to 16 benches 
    // would be classified as a Karvi. These ships were considered to be "general 
    // purpose" ships, mainly used for fishing and trade, but occasionally 
    // commissioned for military use. While most longships held a length to width 
    // ratio of 7:1, the Karvi ships were closer to 4.5:1.[citation needed] The 
    // Gokstad Ship is a famous Karvi ship, built around the end of the 9th century, 
    // excavated in 1880 by Nicolay Nicolaysen.It was approximately 23 m (75 feet) 
    // long with 16 rowing positions.
